# big-give-task

# The task was a little out of my depth having little experience with Javascript. The code is not functioning at the moment as I felt I did not spend enough time on it, although the total number hours of researching and designing the script exceeded the 4 hour limit.

# I made notes of the end goal to enhance the functionality to be controlled via a GUI on a browser, with buttons to invoke the class methods of reserving and collecting funds, and displaying the allocation list. I did not spend enough time to finish this task off, so apologies.

# If the code was functional, simply open the index.html file in a browser and press F12 to view any output to the console. I planned on adding instructions to perform the above actions via the console terminal.

# I hope you are able to get the gist of what I was trying to do, and hope it is easy to follow.
